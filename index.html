            My name is Agnieszka Sikora and I'm at the end of my Computer Science program journey. Throughout my time at SNHU I received a solid foundation in various computer science concepts and skills. By working on different projects and assignments, I have been able to demonstrate my proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java or C++, algorithms, data structures, and software development. 
            Each completed course has added to my knowledge base and allowed me to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems, highlighting my ability to solve complex issues. Completing the coursework in the computer science program has played a pivotal role in shaping my professional goals and values, particularly in my journey toward becoming a data analyst. Through courses focused on data structures,
            statistical analysis, database management, and machine learning, I have developed a deep understanding of how to collect, analyze, and interpret data to derive meaningful insights. This knowledge has not only honed my technical skills but also clarified my passion for leveraging data to solve real-world problems.
